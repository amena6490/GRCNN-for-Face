# GRCNN-for-Face
Gated Recurrent Convolution Neural network for Face Recognition with Combined Angular Loss
The network architecture uses GRCNN and we implements a combined angular margin softmax loss function for face recognition. This code is built upon david's facenet and tested on Tensorflow = 1.4.0

# GRCNN:
This project is an application of GRCNN for face recognition. For details of GRCNN architecture, please refer to the paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6637-gated-recurrent-convolution-neural-network-for-ocr.pdf

# Combined Augular Softmax Lossï¼š
The combined augular softmax introduces the augular margin in cosine theta and adds substract another margin outside the cosine theta.
The combined angular softmax can be written as:

<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/Jianfeng1991/GRCNN-for-Face/blob/master/combined_loss.PNG" width="450" height="120" ></div>

where the s denotes scale factor, m1 and m2 are angular marigin and n is the number of images in a single batch.

# Train a new model
1. Preparing for the datasets: 
All of images for a identity should put in one directory, and the images should be preprocessed by MTCNN. The preprocessing script can be found at process_data.sh.

2. Run the training script:
The training settings are written in train_mscele_vgg_combined.sh. The training datasets we use is a combination of MsCele and VGG datasets which are cleaned by ouselves.

# Inference
In this experiment, we only use MTCNN for face detection and we do not perform face alignment.
We evaluate GRCNN on lfw datasets and it achieve 99.82 % accuracy. The pre-trained model will be relased soon.
